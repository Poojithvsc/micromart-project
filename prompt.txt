I want you to create a project for me. This project should be built in a way that the end result should make me understand how to build an entire project from start to finish (probably a full  
  stack project). I want this project using Java, API,  springboot, kafka, docker, database, s3 bucket maybe, postgresql, unit test cases, terraform, cloud(i have a whizlabs subscription if      
  that helps, i want to be able to Launch EC2 and RDS Instance and connect to RDS Instance from EC2 Instance using Terraform),  etc. include 2 or preferrably 3 microservices so that i can also   
  learn how kafka can be used to communicate within microservices and anything else that i dont know about and need to learn in a full stack development. at the end, i want to be able to
  understand how to successfully  integrate all technologies like . More importantly, I want this project to follow as guidelines the "Patterns of Enterprise Application architecture" by Martin  
  Fowler and follow all of the principles and patterns so that i can see how to use them in an actual application. Also use the springboot concepts like: Core Stereotypes@Controller, @Service,   
  @Repository, @Component, @Entity, @Embeddable1.7.2 Spring Data JPAJpaRepository, @Query, @EntityGraph, @Transactional, Specification, @ManyToOne/@OneToMany1.7.3 Dependency

  and owler's LayerSpring StereotypesConceptsPresentation@Controller, @RestController, Spring MVC (@GetMapping, @RequestBody, @Valid, @ExceptionHandler)ServiceApplication@Service,
  @Transactional, Events (@EventListener, @Async)Domain@Entity, @Embeddable, domain objects (though Spring is agnostic here)Data SourceInfrastructure@Repository, Spring Data JPA (JpaRepository,

  MAKE SURE THAT THE PROJECT USES AS MANY DIFFERENT PARTS OF TECHNOLOGIES AS POSSIBLE FOR ME TO LEARN THEM !!!
